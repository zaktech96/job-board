Prettier
Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code

Before pushing any changes, format the project locally by running:

npm run format:fix
Linting
ESLint is an automation tool, used to save time by making sure everyone's code is following the same standards. By using ESLint we can avoid wasting time on code reviews for simple things like formatting and naming conventions.

Linting configuration lives in eslint .eslintrc.json

Before pushing any changes, lint the project locally by running:

npm run lint
